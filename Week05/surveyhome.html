        <h2>Survey</h2>

        <p>
          A survey is often used in a research project to collect feedback from
          users of a system or participants of an event. Results of the
          evaluation will be of interest to the researcher(s) to help them
          determine whether the approach is likely to affect the objectives set
          in the research.

        <h2>Voluntary Participation</h2>

        <p>
          Participation in surveys is voluntary. You may discontinue
          participation at any time during the research activity and, on
          request, will delete data collected from you (until publication, at
          which point deletion is no longer possible).
